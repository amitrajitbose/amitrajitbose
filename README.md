### Hi there, I'm Jeet 👋

I'm a Software Engineer at Flipkart, previously at Rakuten. Earlier I have worked on various Software Engineering & Machine Learning projects for various organisations, startups and research papers under various professors at my university. I am also a Competitive Programmer and have qualified for the ACM-ICPC 2019 Onsite Regional at Amritapuri.

I have worked on high performance teams working on critical features for large scale E-Commerce companies. I am enthusiastic about scaling and designing large scale distributed systems. Feel free to ping me up for collaboration or hiring!
