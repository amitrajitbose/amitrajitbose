### Hi there, I'm Jeet 👋

I'm a Software Engineer at Flipkart India and I love to solve problems. Earlier I have worked on various Machine Learning projects for various organisations and research papers under various professors at my university. I am also a Competitive Programmer and have qualified for the ACM-ICPC 2019 Onsite Regional at Amritapuri.
